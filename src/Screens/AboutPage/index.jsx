    <h1>A Smart Medical Ecosystem</h1>
      <h3>
        Our aim is to put the patient in control of their medical data, giving
        them the power to share the single, most comprehensive version of their
        record, with every organisation in their medical network. Fragmented,
        siloed patient records create inefficiencies and inaccuracies across the
        breadth of the healthcare system. Medicalchain uses blockchain
        technology to securely manage health records for a collaborative, smart
        approach to healthcare.
